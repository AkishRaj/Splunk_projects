# Analyzing DNS Log Files Using Splunk SIEM

## Overview
DNS (Domain Name System) logs provide crucial insights into network activity and are key for identifying potential security threats. Splunk SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) offers powerful capabilities to ingest, analyze, and visualize DNS logs, helping security analysts detect anomalies or malicious activities in real time.

This repository demonstrates how to upload and analyze DNS log files in Splunk, extract relevant information, identify suspicious activity, and generate actionable insights.
